## Dataset
- [ATOMIC: An Atlas of Machine Commonsense for If-Then Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00146)  
    **ATOMIC** focuses on inferential knowledge organized as typed *If-Then* relations. It has three types of *If-Then* knowledge, and nine new inferential dimensions. This knowledge graph contains 877k triples, 309K nodes, collected using 24K base events. The link for downloading the data is [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-mosaic/public/atomic/v1.0/atomic_data.tgz).
