# NLP_Research
This repository will constantly update some materials (e.g., datasets, papers) about some subfields in Natural Language Processing. I will recommend some awesome papers according to my preference, and make a note (in English) to introduce them. And I will also summarize some basic knowledge (in Chinese) to help better understand these papers.
